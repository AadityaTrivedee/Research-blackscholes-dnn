# Integrating Black Scholes Framework with Deep Learning Network Architecture for Enhanced Options Pricing
The work presents a hybrid approach that integrates the classical Black–Scholes model with deep learning methods. By incorporating Black–Scholes outputs as additional features in a neural network model, the research demonstrates improvements in option pricing accuracy—offering a robust alternative to both the traditional analytical method and stand-alone deep learning approaches.

### Key Findings

- The deep learning model achieves lower MAE compared to the traditional Black–Scholes method.
- The hybrid model, incorporating Black–Scholes outputs, further reduces pricing errors, though gains are modest due to inherent approximation errors in the classical model.
- The approach is effective for both call and put option pricing while maintaining computational efficiency.
